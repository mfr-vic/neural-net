# Neural Network :

This project was made with the intent to better understand and put in practice some concepts of this fantastical yet mysterious world that is machine learning.

## Installation :

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) (renderer) and [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/) (neural net base).

```bash
 pip install numpy
```
```bash
 pip install pygame
```

## Instructions :

1. Download repository
2. Open the directory where the file resides
3. Write *python main.py* on your terminal

    PS : In *defs.py* resides all the definitions used, especially the genetic ones. Just change some parameter and re-run to use it.
